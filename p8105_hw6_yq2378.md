<img src="p8105_hw6_yq2378_files/figure-gfm/plot for ORs and CIs-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The plot provides a visual representation of the estimated odds ratios
(ORs) and their corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) for 47 cities.
Notably, New York, NY exhibits the smallest OR, while Albuquerque, NM
boasts the largest.

Beginning with Atlanta, GA, a distinct trend emerges: the subsequent six
cities exhibit ORs greater than 1. This implies that in these particular
cities, homicide cases involving male victims are more likely to be
resolved compared to those involving female victims. On the contrary,
the remaining 41 cities in the dataset exhibit an inverse relationship,
signifying that homicides with female victims tend to have higher odds
of resolution.

Regarding the error bars in the plot, it’s notable that the cities
positioned towards the right side generally exhibit wider error bars.
This observation suggests a potential issue related to sample size in
these cities. Wider error bars typically indicate increased uncertainty
in the estimated odds ratios, and this could be attributed to smaller
sample sizes for certain cities.
